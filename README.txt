Here's the supplementation for marking purposes for GROUP B - Project 3660:1. Before any operation on the database, you will be prompted to log in first. You have to insert into the "staff"​ table first. The staff ID should start at 1.2. In case you want to use the existing database on this server (http://vlamp.cs.uleth.ca/~traj3660/), the log in details are:            username: test            password: passThe staff ID for this user is 6.
